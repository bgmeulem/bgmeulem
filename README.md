Hi! I'm Bjorge Meulemeester. Welcome to my github profile.

# Computational neuroscience
I'm currently pursuing a PhD in computational neuroscience. I'm the maintainer of [In Silico Framework (ISF)](https://mpinb.github.io/in_silico_framework): a multi-scale simulation environment for the generation, simulation and analysis of mechanistically detailed _in vivo_ neuron-network interactions. ISF has a specific focus on capturing biological diversity and parameter degeneracy.

> The response of a layer 5 pyramidal neuron in the rat barrel cortex to an airpuff to the whiskers. Reconstructed from and constrained with in vivo data. Simulated with ISF (using NEURON) and visualized in blender. 

# Astronomy
As means of a hobby project, as well as an exercise to sharpen my Python skills, I've recreated Luminet's famous 1979 paper 'Image of a Spherical Black Hole with Thin Accretion Disk' in Python. You can find the source code at [bgmeulem/Luminet](https://github.com/bgmeulem/luminet). Package available from the Anaconda and PyPI repositories.

# Biophysics
My thesis explored the possibilities of applying supervised machine learning on clinical Carto (Biosense Webster inc.) mapping data. This involved lots of simulations and a fair deal of mesh (re)construction for finite element simulations with openCARP. The repo [bgmeulem/Reconstruct_Carto](https://github.com/bgmeulem/Reconstruct_CARTO) showcases cleaned code capable of reconstructing clinical Carto data to a mesh that can be used for electrophysiological simulations. This repo is now featured on [openCARP's modeling resources](https://opencarp.org/community/modeling-resources#mesh-generation-tools).
